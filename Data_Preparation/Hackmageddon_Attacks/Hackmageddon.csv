The source code was allegedly obtained from The hacking of Indian Military Servers.[xiii] Symantec admits that “a segment of its source code used in two of our older enterprise products has been accessed”.[xiv]     During the same operation the same hackers also leak some other  documents according to which:
1. The Indian government has source code for Symantec’s AV software, albeit of 2006 vintage.
2. The Indian government is strong arming cell phone manufacturers to provide back doors into their handsets (defined RINOA: RIM, Nokia and Apple) ;
3. The Indian government is in possession of confidential internal communications from the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC).
4. The Indian government is actively engaged in espionage efforts targeting not only the USCC, but potentially thousands of US government networks, ranging from those of federal agencies to systems used by state and municipal entities. 
 In any case, although the leaked source code is real, it looks like the Lords of Dharmaraja faked the government memo (in order to attract more attention) since some emails there contained (and purportedly obtained by the RINOA backdoors) were allegedly stolen from the Indian Embassy on Paris and appear to have already been leaked on pastebin in December by the same hacker @YamaTough.
