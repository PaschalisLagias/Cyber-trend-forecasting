The file **MTGNN.py** contains a script for evaluating the performance of the MTGNN model in forecasting 142 cyber trends, predicting 36 time-steps ahead (multistep forecast). The experiment is repeated five times and the average errors (RSE and RAE) are computed and printed on the terminal. The errors can be copied and saved to the file **outb1.txt**.

In each of the five experiments, the script performs random search with 30 iterations to optimise the set of hyperparameters. That is, it finds the model with the least validation error. The best model is finally saved to the file **modelb1.pt** and used to forecast the unseen data. The model can be thought of as a Bayesian model with a single iteration hence the use of b1 in the naming of the files (e.g., model file).
