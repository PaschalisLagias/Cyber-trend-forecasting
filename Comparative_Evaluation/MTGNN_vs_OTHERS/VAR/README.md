The file **VAR.py** contains a script for training and assessing the VAR model's forecasting performance for 142 cyber trends, predicting 36 time-steps ahead (multistep forecast). A distinct model is constructed for each trend which uses 3 additional features besides the ground turth. These are (**NoM, ACA, and PH**). Evaluation of the final results, comprising 36 times 142 values, is conducted based on RSE and RAE metrics. The forecast values are saved in **forecast_results_VAR.csv**. Upon completion of the script, RSE and RAE values are displayed on the terminal and can be copied and saved in **out_VAR.txt** for reference.
